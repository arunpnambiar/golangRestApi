# CRUD RESTful API with Go, GORM, JWT and Database(postgres/mysql)

In this project:
We will build a CRUD application with golang.Golang is a general-purpose programming language built for the multi-core reality of today’s computers.

**About Project:**

This is a demo rest API using golang. Here we are using Gorila mux for routing, GROM for database connectivity and ORM methods.
For authentication we will use JWT token. For run golang project first you need to run below packages

  1. **gorilla/mux** — A powerful URL router and dispatcher. We use this package to match URL paths with their handlers.
  2. **jinzhu/gorm** — The fantastic ORM library for Golang, aims to be developer friendly. We use this ORM(Object relational mapper) package                      to interact smoothly with our database
  3. **dgrijalva/jwt-go** — Used to sign and verify JWT tokens
  4. **joho/godotenv** — Used to load .env files into the project
  
  To install any of this package, open terminal and run below command.
     `go get github.com/{package-name}`
